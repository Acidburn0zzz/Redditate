Redditate
=================

Redditate is a simple Reddit reader that aims to make the browsing experience more pleasurable :)


Why am I making it?
-----

I effin love browsing Reddit, but I wish I had a way to browse it that was a bit more friendly and beautiful. Reddit's design is functional, but I wanted to strip it down and make it my own. I've been noodling on this on evenings when I just need to unwind, so don't expect timely progress.
