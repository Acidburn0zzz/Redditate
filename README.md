Redditorial
=================

Redditorial is a simple Reddit reader that aims to make the browsing experience more pleasurable :)


Why am I making it?
-----

I effin love browsing Reddit, but I wish I had a way to browse it that was a bit more friendly and beautiful. Reddit's design is functional, but I wanted to strip it down and make it my own.


What works right now?
-----

+ Browsing the front page or any subreddit - click the dropdown in the fixed header
+ Using fullview and listview - cookies your preference
+ Coming back brings you back to same scroll position
+ Inline imgur and youtube - click them to play or zoom in
+ Click images to see max-size inline


What's coming next?
-----------

+ Get an AJAX spinner in place
+ Only cookie scroll position when you come back (not on any page)
+ Embed even mislinked imgur photos
+ Mag glass for images that resize
+ Hookup gridview properly
+ Click to open comments in a modal
+ Link images properly everywhere
+ Cleanup JS and fix jenk code
+ Reconsider youtube embed cause it breaks a lot
